## Running with Docker

This uploader is available as a docker image.
Either pull the image from dockerhub to run manually or use the docker-compose for pre-configured instances.

If using the docker-compose, ensure all the files in this directory are placed in the same directory as the docker-compose.

#### You will need to include a config.ini in the same directory too.

By default, the docker-compose will run the scheduler.
